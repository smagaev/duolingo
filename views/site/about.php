        While self-studying English on the Internet, I came across the site <a href="https://duolingo.com">duolingo.com</a>, which I really liked! I have been studying on this site for a year and have almost completed the entire English course. Everything is good here, but for a very long time. According to the recommendations, it is desirable to write out the studied words for better assimilation. What I did! However! Repeating them, as practice has shown, is not very convenient, and it is pointless. Already learned words constantly come across, others, not studied, come across rarely. It would be nice to sift out the studied material! Therefore, in order to simplify the memorization of words and speed up the repetition of the material covered, I wrote a small free program, which I want to bring to your attention.

    The site allows you not only to study the words I have collected, but also the words that you add yourself! Added languages can be not only in English and Russian, but also in any other. True, the site interface is presented only in Russian, German and English.
    To add your own words, view statistics, and exclude learned words from the learning process, you need to register on the site.
